# HunterList

Hunter List is an app designed in iOS that was made to help people that play Hunt: Showdown. Hunter List allows for users to create loadouts for their hunters in game. 
The app will then calculate the total cost of hunter. The app allows for you to input every hunter that you have in your current roster and keep track of them.

Hunter List also allows for the user to keep track of which characters in your roster are dead and which are alive. This makes it easier to see the amount of money 
lost from previous hunters that have died.
